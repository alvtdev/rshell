#Rshell
##The mandatory brainchild of all UCR cs-100 students.

###What is rshell? 
Rshell is a simple shell for unix systems that students in the UCR CS100 course are required to create.
It is essentially an unfinished, more limited version of Bash.

###Current Features
*Executes commands (e.g. ls, mkdir, etc.)
*Supports comments (commands entered in as a comment will not be executed)
*handles "exit" as well as the EOF command.
*prints a "Goodbye" message when terminated.
*A syntax error message will be printed when one is detected.

###Known bugs
*Any command entered that begins with a semicolon causes an error.
*Some memory leaks occur. (but will be fixed).
